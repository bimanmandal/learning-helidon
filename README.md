Difference Between Helidon SE vs Helidon MP

Helidon SE is pure reactive Java: no annotations, no dependency injection, no blocking code. It is as small and light and fast as possible.

Helidon MP implements Eclipse MicroProfile, using CDI (including extensions) for inversion of control, JAX-RS annotations for RESTful services, and imperative coding.
